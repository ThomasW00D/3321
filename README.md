## Installation
Before installing this project, you must have both Python and PyQt5 installed on your local machine. <br>
Once installed, you should see a button to copy the link to this respository. If not, it can be found in the address bar.<br>
Once you've copied the link, you can clone this repository to your local machine. Finally, open the repository in your code editor or use the command-line to run the main GUI file.
## Usage
Once the Installation steps have been completed, you are now ready to run the email client. <br>
Within the cloned repository you can launch the project by running the "Main_Login.py" file. <br>
After running the above file the splash screen will load into the main selection window. <br>
From the selection window you can direct yourself from the email client, Join Server, or Host Server options. <br>
Before attempting to use the email client visit the following [quickstart page](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python).
There you will be directed on how to install everything needed for using the GMail API. 
Once you have your credentials.json file moved to your working directory, you may then login to the email client by clicking on the Email Client buton.<br>
If it's your first time logging in you'll be directed to your browser where you can then login using your GMail account.
If you've logged in before, then a token.json file will be automatically generated which allows you to skip this process once you've logged in once.
From there, the GMail GUI will appear where you'll be presented with a variety of options to view specific emails, such as Spam or Trash.
Along with this you'll be able to compose and send emails as well as recieve emails in real time using the refresh button. <br>
If you select the Host Server option, the Host GUI will open. <br>
From here you can create a new server and send messages as the host which will appear in the Message Log. <br>
In the Server Log box you can find the Host Ip as well as Host Port, which can be used to connect to the created server with the Join Server option. <br>
If you select the Join Server option, the Join GUI will open. <br>
From here you can provide a server's Host Ip as well as Host Port in order to connect to a server. <br>
Once you have connected to a server you can use the Send Message box to send messages to the host server, sent messages will appear in the message log box. <br>
